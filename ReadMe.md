## Final Project for 590

# Overview

 PUBG is a video game that stands for Players Unknown Battle Ground. It was one of the original battle royale video games and has inspired countless video games to adopt the battle royale style. In PUBG you parachute in to a large map with 100 other players and scavenge for supplies and weapons, the last person standing wins. PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds (PUBG) has enjoyed massive popularity. With over 50 million copies sold, it's the fifth best selling game of all time, and has millions of active monthly players.

 This specific competition looks at being able to place players rank within a  game. The data represents over 65000 games.

# EDA

  The data exploration is done in the file EDA. In this file we will examine the data, both training and test, clean the data, and write it back to S3. This is so that we can import the cleaned data into a modeling file for modeling specifically.

  As an avid player of battle royale video games I was excited to learn that this was a competition on Kaggle.

  Based on the data I am hoping to look at some of my initial assumption about the data that I discuss in the EDA document.

  From the EDA file I will do any cleaning that is needed and then write back to S3 for use in a separate modeling file.

# Modeling

  In this file I am performing SVM to meet assignment requirements but I am also performing a stacked model as well.
